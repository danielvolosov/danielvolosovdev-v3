I use a lot of different hardware/software for different purposes. The following sections will break down some of my setup and favorites.

## Software Tools

1. Visual Studio Code is my primary editor and go-to for any front-end work.

2. Eclipse is my editor for most back end work. I've primarily worked with Java/Spring & enjoy the open nature of this IDE.

3. iTerm 2 is my go-to terminal emulator. Love the customization!

4. Firefox is my primary browser. I enjoy the dev tools very much, and the layout is more effective than Chrome for me. I do test my apps on most browsers.

## Hardware Setup

1. I use an LG 34WN80C-B 34" Ultrawide for my work. I find it incredibly helptful to have all of my apps organized on a single display.

2. I use a 2019 16" MacBook Pro with 32gb RAM & 8-Core i9 Processor + 1TB SSD. I genuinely enjoy MacOS for just about everything. I also use a Magic Keyboard with the number pad. Those things can hold a charge for months!

3. I just purchased a Logitech MX3 Master mouse. It's so comfortable!

4. I also have a Custom built gaming PC. It's a monster, but I only use it for gaming.

5. My current headset is a Bose QC35 II. I've had it since I started my first development job in 2017. I just replaced the ear cushions since they wore out completely, but it's still going.

6. I use an iPhone XS 256GB for mobile purposes. I will likely never need that much storage and really overspent on it.

I hope you enjoyed my setup! Check out some of the other cool ones at [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/).
